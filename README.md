# 911_Baltimore_Call-Analysis_Tableau

I conducted an analysis of the 911 calls made in Baltimore during the year 2021 utilizing Tableau Desktop. Subsequently, I authored a concise one-page 
classified report based on the findings. Additionally, I crafted a compact dashboard to demonstrate my adeptness with Tableau. While this iteration does
not represent the ultimate version of the dashboard, it does serve to illustrate my methodology in addressing such complex issues
